#+title: Singularity Containers for Wire-Cell Toolkit

This repo holds a variety of approaches to leveraging Singularity
containers to provide different environments related to running and
developing the Wire-Cell Toolkit either as stand-alone software or as
run from LArSoft.

This variety can be a source of complexity and the approaches go from
prescriptive to open-ended.

- [[wcdo.org][wcdo]] :: this approach is the most coddling and prescriptive but has
     some hooks for user customization.

- [[wcsing.org][wcsing]] :: and older approach with some rough edges.

Besides Singularity, you probably want to set up some other things:

- [[cvmfs.org][cvmfs]] :: a file system which can be used to easily access UPS binary
     "products" provided by Fermilab.  Using this saves you from
     having to manually copy them.
