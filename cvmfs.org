#+title: CVMFS

CVMFS is a file system which mounts remote directories over HTTP.
CVMFS is also by many to distribute software binaries.  Once set up it
provides the simplest way to access UPS product areas provided by
Fermilab.

It has excellent documentation which needs no repeating here other
than to link:

- [[https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/downloads][CVMFS download instructions]]
- [[https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/quickstart][CVMFS quickstart]] 

However, for getting access to UPS product areas, here are the salient
parts:

Edit ~/etc/cvmfs/default.local~ to look something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# required, add more if needed.
CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=larsoft.opensciencegrid.org,uboone.opensciencegrid.org,dune.opensciencegrid.org
# requires, replace with actual proxy, or just "DIRECT" if none
CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY="http://my.local.proxy:1234;DIRECT"

# Optional but recomended:

# limit how much cache is used on your computer, units in MB
CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=25000

# If not set, some default is chosen (/var/lib/cvmfs/shared).
# Best to put the cache on your fastest disk which has enough space.
CVMFS_CACHE_BASE=/mnt/ssd/cvmfs
#+END_EXAMPLE

Read comments and change example values appropriately.  Refer to CVMFS
documentation for details.

Check if things work:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# cvmfs_config probe 
Probing /cvmfs/larsoft.opensciencegrid.org... OK
Probing /cvmfs/uboone.opensciencegrid.org... OK
Probing /cvmfs/dune.opensciencegrid.org... OK
#+END_EXAMPLE
